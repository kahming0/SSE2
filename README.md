# About Hugging Carbon

As artificial intelligence (AI) usage increases, so does its environ-
mental impact, with AI models consuming significant energy and
contributing to carbon emissions. However, users often lack ac-
cessible tools to visualize the sustainability of different models.
We introduce Hugging Carbon, a web-based platform that
visualizes the carbon emissions of AI models hosted on Hugging
Face, providing transparency and enabling users to make informed,
sustainability-conscious decisions.

The data is provided by Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-llm-leaderboard/contents/resolve/main/data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet.
